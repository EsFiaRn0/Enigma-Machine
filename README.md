<h1 align="center"> Enigma Machine </h1>

This project is a functional implementation of the Enigma machine, historically used to encrypt and decrypt messages during World War II. Built with Python Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, it simulates the machineâ€™s operation.

Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using configurable rotors and a plugboard, with the ability to save, delete, or reset settings as needed.
