<h1 align="center"> Enigma Machine </h1>

This project is a functional implementation of the Enigma machine, historically used to encrypt and decrypt messages during World War II. Built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for the backend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, it simulates the machine‚Äôs operation.

Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using configurable rotors and a plugboard, with the ability to save, delete, or reset settings as needed.

## Features  
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Encode and decode messages using a fully functional Enigma machine simulation.  
- **Save Encrypted Messages:** Store encrypted messages for later use or reference.  
- **Reset Rotors & Plugboard:** Easily reset the machine's rotors and plugboard to default settings.  
- **Configurable Rotors:** Users can interactively set up and adjust rotors for encryption.  
- **Interactive Plugboard:** Customize letter swaps dynamically for added encryption complexity.  
- **Delete Last Character:** Remove the last letter entered for better control while typing.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**  
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (for cloning the repository)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:EsFiaRn0/Enigma-Machine.git
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
  venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
To exit the virtual environment:

```bash
  deactivate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies.
Since Flask is the only dependency, install it using pip as recommended by the official [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) documentation:

```bash
  pip install flask
```
### 4. Run the Application
You can start the Flask server using either of the following commands:

```bash
  cd Enigma-Machine
  python app.py
```
or 
```bash
  cd Enigma-Machine
  flask run
```
